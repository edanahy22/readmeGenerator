## Development
This application was developed using javaScript, node, and Inquirer package.

## Usage
In the command-line, the user inputs "node index.js" to run the application.

The user is prompted with questions to fill out information about their README, including the title, description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, License, Tests, and Questions. Then the user will be asked to input their email and GitHub username so others have a way to contact them with their questions.

Once the user answers the prompts, a READMME is generated containing all of the user input information. The README will include a title,table of content, a license badge, and all of the user-input information.
